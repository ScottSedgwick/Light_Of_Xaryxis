# Rules and Notes

## Character creation

- Players roll for their characters stats.  Roll 4d6, re-roll 1s and 2s.  Take the sum of the best 3 dice.  Repeat 6 times.
- Players roll for their characters hit points.  First level is maximum HP.  Subsequent levels are rolled for, but rolls under 50% on the dice are re-rolled.
- Characters start at 5th level.
- All the characters know each other at the start of the campaign - feel free to work out a backstory.
