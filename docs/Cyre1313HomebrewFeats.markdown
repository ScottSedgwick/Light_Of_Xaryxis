## Stance Mastery

You are a master of various combat stances, each representing a different aspect of your training. You can seamlessly flow between these stances, adapting to the ebb and flow of battle with grace and precision.

You gain access to a set of combat stances. You can adopt a stance as a bonus action on your turn, and you can then freely switch between stances during the remainder of your turn as if it were an object interaction. You can maintain a stance constantly, however if you wish to change your stance outside of the turn you used a bonus action, you will need to use another bonus action to do so.
