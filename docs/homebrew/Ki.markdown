# Dennis' Ki

This is a list of Dennis' Ki related abilities. It does not include Monk abilities that use no ki, except that Shadow Step _is_ included because that's homebrew to Dennis.

Dennis is currently 11th level, and primarily uses the OneDND rules for Monks.  However, he continues to refer to his abilities as Ki based, instead of Discipline based as the OneDND rules refer to it.

He gets one Ki point per level, so Dennis currently has 11 Ki points, which refresh on a short rest.

## Monk Ki abilities

| Level | Source | Ability |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | 
| 2     | PHB    | Monk's discipline - access to Ki points. |
| 2     | PHB    | Flurry of Blows: expend 1 ki point to make 2 unarmed strikes as a bonus action. |
| 2     | PHB    | Patient Defense: take the Disengage action as a bonus action. |
| 2     | PHB    | Patient Defense (ki): expend 1 ki point to take both the Disengage and Dodge actions as a bonus action. |
| 2     | PHB    | Step of the Wind: take the Dash action as a bonus action. |
| 2     | PHB    | Step of the Wind (ki): expend 1 ki point to take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a bonus action. |
| 2     | PHB    | Uncanny Metabolism: once per long rest, when rolling initiative, regain all ki points and one MA die + monk level HP. |
| 3     | Tasha  | Ki-fuelled attack: if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make a flurry of blows attack as a bonus action. |
| 5     | PHB    | Stunning Strike: Expend 1 ki point to attempt a Stunning Strike. Target must make a CON save. On failure, the target is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a save, the target takes Force damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. |
| 5     | Tasha  | Focused Aim. When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each ki point spent, potentially turning the miss into a hit. |
| 10    | PHB    | Improved Flurry of Blows: expend one ki point to make 3 unarmed strikes as a bonus action. |
| 10    | PHB    | Improved Patient Defense (ki): When you expend a ki point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 2 rolls of your MA die. |
| 10    | PHB    | Improved Step of the Wind (ki): When you spend a ki point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of you that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature's movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. |

## Path of Mercy abilities

| Level | Source | Ability |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| 3     | Tasha  | Hand of Healing. Expend 1 ki point to heal a number of HP equal to one roll of your MA die + your Wisdom modifier. |
| 3     | Tasha  | Hand of Harm. Expend 1 ki point to deal extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your MA die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn. |
| 6     | Tasha  | Physician's Touch. When you use Hands of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned or stunned. |
| 11    | Tasha  | Flurry of Healing and Harm. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hand of Healing, without spending ki points for the healing. In addition, you can use Hand of Harm without spending the ki points for Hand of Harm. You can still only use Hand of Harm once per turn. |

## Ethan Homebrew

### Shadow Step

At level 9, Monks normally gain the feature Acrobatic Movement. This would be useless for Dennis as his Fairy and Dhampir abilities already provide him with those abilities. Ethan allowed me to replace that ability with the 6th level ability from the Monk Path of Shadows, Shadow Step.  

> In dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of your turn.

### Astral Cord Whip

Ethan granted Dennis this homebrew ability after the party _massacred_ an Astral Dreadnaught.  See [here](/Light_Of_Xaryxis/magicitems/AstralCordWhip.html) for details.
