# Carrying people

- Willing creatures: Use carrying capacity, object interaction to initiate (No Penalty)
- Unconscious creatures: Grapple rules but no contested check (Difficult Terrain) (Having Grappler feat or strength based feat will remove difficult terrain)

# Potions

- Once per turn, as a free interaction, you can drink any potion of healing.
- Drinking a potion as a bonus action you roll the dice.
- Drinking a potion as a full action you get maximum from the roll instead.
- You can drink a total potential of 3 potions a turn via action, bonus action and free interaction

# Leveling Up 

- When you roll for health when leveling up you reroll until you at least get half.

# Spells 

- Shield can be cast on others.
- For the term “enters for the first time”in a spell  the terminology implies a willing movement into the space. If they’re already in that space, they are not entering it, and therefore won’t take the damage. (ie, if you cast moonbeam on a space where the creature already is, they don’t take damage, but if you cast it on yourself and then they willing move closer into the moonbeam, thats when it counts)

# Crits 

- Maximum Damage of the roll automatically as well as rolling the damage ordinarily and a card gets drawn for an extra effect.

# Stunned Condition 

- On each of its turns, the stunned creature can take its action or bonus action, but not both.
- The stunned creature’s speed is 0.
- The stunned creature cannot take reactions.
- The stunned creature can only make a single attack on each of its turns.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

# Drowning/Suffocating 

- You start with a minimum of 3 breaths + your con modifier. You lose a breath at the end of each turn or if you use any verbal components.
