## Stance Mastery

You are a master of various combat stances, each representing a different aspect of your training. You can seamlessly flow between these stances, adapting to the ebb and flow of battle with grace and precision.

You gain access to a set of combat stances. You can adopt a stance as a bonus action on your turn, and you can then freely switch between stances during the remainder of your turn as if it were an object interaction. You can maintain a stance constantly, however if you wish to change your stance outside of the turn you used a bonus action, you will need to use another bonus action to do so.

| No | Stance | Bonus | Description |
| -- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1 | Defensive Stance | +1 to AC | This stance emphasizes defense and precision, allowing the character to deflect attacks with ease. |
| 2 | Offensive Stance | +1d4 to damage rolls | This aggressive stance focuses on maximizing striking power, delivering powerful blows to overwhelm opponents. |
| 3 | Mobile Stance | +10 feet movement speed | A swift and nimble stance that enhances the character's mobility, making it easier to navigate the battlefield. |
| 4 | Precision Stance | Add you Wisdom modifier to attack rolls | By attuning to their inner senses, the character gains heightened accuracy in their strikes. |
| 5 | Counter Stance | Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage | This stance is all about turning an opponent's attack against them, creating openings for counterattacks. |
