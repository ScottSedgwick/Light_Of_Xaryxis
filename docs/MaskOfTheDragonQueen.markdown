# Mask of the Dragon Queen

Source: Tyranny of Dragons

*Wondrous item, unique (requires attunement)*

Individually, the five Dragon Masks resemble the dragons they are named for. When two or more of the dragon masks are assembled, however, they transform magically into the Mask of the Dragon Queen. Each mask shrinks to become the modeled head of a chromatic dragon, appearing to roar its devotion to Tiamat where all the masks brought together are arranged crown-like on the wearer's head. Below the five masks, a new mask shapes itself, granting the wearer a draconic visage that covers the face, neck, and shoulders.

While you are attuned to and wear this mask, you can have any of the properties from any one mask. Additionally, you gain the Damage Absorption from each of the five Dragon Masks, and you gain five uses of the Legendary Resistance property.

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

Each dragon mask is a legendary wondrous item that reshapes to fit the face and head of a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing any dragon mask and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits.

***Damage Absorption.*** You have resistance against the mask's damage type. If you already have resistance to that damage type from another source, you instead have immunity to that damage type. If you already have immunity to that damage type from another source, whenever you are subjected to damage of that type, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt of that type.

***Draconic Majesty.*** While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.

***Dragon Breath.*** If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.

***Dragon Tongue.*** You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against dragons that share the mask's color.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.
