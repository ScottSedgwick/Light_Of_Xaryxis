            <h2>Stance Mastery</h2>
            <p>
                You are a master of various combat stances, each representing a
                different aspect of your training. You can seamlessly flow
                between these stances, adapting to the ebb and flow of battle
                with grace and precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                You gain access to a set of combat stances. You can adopt a
                stance as a bonus action on your turn, and you can then freely
                switch between stances during the remainder of your turn as if
                it were an object interaction. You can maintain a stance
                constantly, however if you wish to change your stance outside of
                the turn you used a bonus action, you will need to use another
                bonus action to do so.
