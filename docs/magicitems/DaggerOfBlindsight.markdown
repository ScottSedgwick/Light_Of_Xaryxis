# Dagger of Blindsight

Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage

*Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)*

This rare magic item requires attunement. A creature attuned to it gains blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The dagger has a saw-toothed edge and a black pearl nested in its pommel.
