# Potion Cache

Source: Ethan's Homebrew

*Wondrous item*

This item is a direct gift from Ao, and as such its rarity cannot be determined and the item cannot be replicated.

This cache is held by one party member, but every member of the party can attune to it without using an attunement slot, and can thereafter place potions into it, and take potions out of it, at will.  Think of it like a shared bag of holding, just for potions.

As an artifact of Ao, it is unclear if this item suffers from the downsides of other extra-dimensional spaces with regards to interaction with other extra dimensional spaces.  It may, or may not, cause the other extra dimensional space to rupture.  All that is known for sure is that the Cache is practically indestructible, and it would not be destroyed - but the other extra dimensional item may be.

The holder of the Cache is responsible for keeping track of the contents.
