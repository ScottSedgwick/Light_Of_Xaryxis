# Cerebral Circlet

_Wondrous Item, Rare_

_A thin, metallic circlet adorned with pulsating veins of violet light. When worn, it seems to hum faintly in tune with the wearerâ€™s thoughts._

*Psionic Amplification*: While wearing the Cerebral Circlet, you can use your action to amplify your psionic or mental abilities. Once per long rest, you can target a creature within 60 feet that you can see. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

If the wearer has Psionic powers without the circlet, the psychic damage is doubled to 8d8.

*Additional Effect*: The circlet grants advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to psionics or psychic phenomena.
