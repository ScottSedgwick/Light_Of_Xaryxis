## Bane's Bow of Melodies

_Short Bow, very rare (requires attunement)_

Given to The Captain by the God Bane, this one is extra special. It is an Ebon Black short bow which constantly releases wisps of smoke.

This bow has multiple strings and resembles a lyre or small harp. By strumming the strings while setting an arrow to the bow, you imbue the arrow with magic.

You can play one of the following melodies when you use the bow to make a ranged weapon attack. You must choose to do so before you make the attack roll, and you can play only one melody per attack.

**Melody of Precision.** If youâ€™re proficient in Performance, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll. If you have expertise in Performance, you gain a +2 bonus instead.

**Melody of Reverberation.** The melody you strum echoes loudly. On a hit, the target takes extra thunder damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Bane of Landlubbers** Grants the wielder the ability to cast [*Bane*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bane) a number of times up to their proficiency bonus per day.  Uses are regained at the next dawn.

**Baneful Critical** On a critical hit, the bow casts [*Bane*](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bane) on the target and two other persons specified by the wielder. This does not consume a use of **Bane of the Landlubber**.  The wielder can choose for this not to happen if they so desire.

**Extra Attack** Grants the wielder an extra attack that also receives the benefit of sneak attack.
