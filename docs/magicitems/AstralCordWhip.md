# Astral Cord Whip

Source: Ethan's Homebrew

*Ki ability (whip) +2*

Whip: 1d4 slashing, Finnesse, Reach (10')

The whip requires 1 ki to be expended for each round it is brought into existence.

On a critical hit against any creature, the whip gains one charge, to a maximum of three.  

On a critical hit against a creature in the Ethereal plane, a creature native to the Astral plane, or a creature that is incorporeal, that creature is instantly killed.

On a critical hit against any creature, the wielder can expend 3 charges to instantly kill that creature.

The instant kill feature of this weapon is subject to DM discretion to prevent one-shotting of BBEGs.

The instant kill feature work by breaking the connection between the creature's soul or animating force, and their body.

For the purposes of this whip, a critical hit only counts as one achieved by rolling a natural 20.
