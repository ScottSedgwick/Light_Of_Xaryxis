# Astral Cord Whip

Source: Ethan's Homebrew

*Weapon (whip) +2*

Whip: 1d4 slashing, Finnesse, Reach (10')

The whip requires 1 ki to be expended for each round it is brought into existence.

On a critical hit against a creature in the Ethereal plane, a creature native to the Astral plane, or a creature that is incorporeal, the creature is instantly killed (limited by DM discretion).

On a critical hit against any creature, the whip gains one charge.  The wielder can expend 3 charges on a hit on any creature to instantly kill it.
