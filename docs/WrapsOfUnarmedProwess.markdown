*Wondrous Item, varies*

While you’re wearing these cloth wraps, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you gain a bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, determined by the wraps’ rarity.

| Rarity    | Bonus |
| --------- | ----- |
| Uncommon  |    +1 |
| Rare      |    +2 |
| Very Rare |    +3 |
