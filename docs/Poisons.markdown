They view their allies as horrible monsters and their enemies are invisible to them (unless they have _Blindsight_, then they view them as monsters too). Their reaction depends on the humanoid that was poisoned. A _Paladin_, for example, might attack. A weak individual may run away as far as they can.<br/>**_Dreams:_** The target enters a state of bliss. They view everyone as extremely friendly. Hazardous environments may appear as swimming pools or beds.
