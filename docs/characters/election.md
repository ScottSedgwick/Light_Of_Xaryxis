### Summary.  

#### House of Representatives (in the order they appear on the ballot)

--- 

##### [Liberal](https://www.liberal.org.au/policy) (Scott Yung)

Turns out Bennelong is considered Australia's most marginal seat in this election, and Scott is the (very close) favourite.

Various stories have been popping up, then hushed, about irregularities regarding his electoral funding, and his closeness of ties to China in general, and Xie Xiongming, and Chinese high roller gambler in particular.

Given how "marginal" this seat is supposed to now be, it makes sense that the Liberals would be throwing money at political advertising, but this guy is _everywhere_.

Anyway, Liberals. Peter Dutton: terrible energy policy, Trump lover.

---

##### [Heart Party](https://heartparty.com.au/Policies) (Barry Devine)

Anti-compulsory vaccination, pro-holistic medicine.  In favour of bringing Australian manufacturing back inside our shores.  Pro-anonymous financial transactions.

Sounds like Trump's policies, in Australia.

---

##### [Trumpet of Patriots](https://trumpetofpatriots.org/policies/) (Robert Nalbandian)

This is the Clive Palmer party.  It's their last chance at getting seats, because the new electoral funding laws (aimed at Teals) come in next election, and it will - coincidentally, I'm sure - destroy this party.

They favour the creation of a DOGE (Department of Governmental Efficiency) in Australia.  Clive wants to be Australia's Elon Musk.

They favour a dramatic reduction in immigration, which will magically reduce housing prices.

They want to ban the Aboriginal flag.

They are explicitly against Net Zero, want us out of the Paris climate agreement and basically want to take all environmental controls away.

Also - and I quote - they want to "get the woke out of our schools".

---

##### [ALP](https://alp.org.au/policies) (Jerome Laxale)

Jerome Laxale is the sitting member for Bennelong.  As a result, he has a page on They Vote For You:

https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/bennelong/jerome_laxale

It's an interesting read, given he has almost certainly voted the Labor party line - you get to see what Labor wants to happen.

Labor party - their policies are not weird, and also not radical.  No huge promises, no crazy demands.

---

##### [Greens](https://greens.org.au/platform) (Adam Hart)

Greens - tax billionaires more, more funding for public schooling, break the supermarket duopoly, add Dental to Medicare and up the GP payment/stop GP co-payments.  And environmental stuff, like you'd think.

---

##### [Family First](https://www.familyfirstparty.org.au/policies) (Eric Chan)

Ban LBGTQIA+ everything.  Make it illegal for teachers to not inform parents of their children's decision to change gender.  Ban gender changing medicine. Abolish "diversity" (their words).  Abolish anti-vilification and anti-discrimination laws.

They want a Royal Commission into the handling of COVID-19. No idea why.

They want to make paying a prostitute for sex illegal.  This is the Finnish model - _being_ a prostitute, and _accepting_ money for sex is perfectly legal.  _Paying_ for sex is illegal.  It effectively shuts down prostitution as a business without making prostitutes criminals.

They want to close drug injecting centres.

---

##### [One Nation](https://www.onenation.org.au/issues) (Craig Bennett)

It's Pauline Hanson's party.  They hide their policies behind images what you have to click on.  I don't want to read that stuff - you know what's under there.  Read it yourself.

---

##### [FUSION](https://www.fusionparty.org.au/policy) (John August)

The Fusion Party's website is trash - or at least, the source location for their images falls afoul of Cochlear's draconian firewall.  As a result, I can read it, but I cannot see any pretty pictures.

They are very much in favour of limiting CO2 emissions.  

They want to improve our public education, and they want Universities focused on education instead of profit.

They are in favour of anti-corruption bodies and whistleblower protections.  They want a federal ICAC.

They want an Australian Bill of Rights.  Not sure that one is a good idea.

They want to decriminalise assisted dying.

---

#### Senate (in the order they appear on the ballot, except for parties that appear above)

--- 

##### [Socialist Equality Party](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/pages/sep/australia/home.html)

These guys don't have their own website - they only exist as articles on the World Socialist Web Site.  As such, it's difficult to get at their actual policies.

---

##### [Australia's Voice](https://australiasvoice.com.au/)

Banking Reform, supermarket divestiture, end political perks, become a Republic, stop Gaza (not sure how), resource rent taxation.

---

##### [Animal Justice Party](https://www.animaljusticeparty.org/federal_election_2025)

Fairer tax system, affordable housing - and LOTs of climate/animal welfare policies.

---

##### [Australian Christians](https://australianchristians.org.au/federal-election-2025/)

No abortion, no assisted dying, protect the church, less tax, support the farmers and build up our defence forces.

---

##### [Legalise Cannabis](https://www.legalisecannabis.org.au/party-policy)

Policy #1 - legalise cannabis.  That's about it.

---

##### [Sustainable Australia](https://www.sustainableaustralia.org.au/policies)

NOT anti-immigration, despite the name.  Pro-science, anti-corruption policies, and a universal basic income.

---

##### [Indigenous - Aboriginal Party of Australia](https://www.indigenouspartyofaustralia.com/our-policies)

Every single policy is pro-indigenous.  Kudos for keeping focus.  No policies at all if you are not indigenous.

---

##### [Jacqui Lambie Network](https://lambienetwork.com.au/)

No policies at all.  There is a link to Jacqui's voting record, and they have 4 campaigns they are running - "Fight Back Against Foreign Interference", "Make Australia Make Again", "Defend Those Who Defend Us" and "Clean Up Canberra".  That last one is anti-corruption, not pick up litter.

---

##### [Citizens Party](https://citizensparty.org.au/policies)

Isolationist - No AUKUS, economic sovereignty (what does that _mean_?), energy security (pro nuclear power), food and fuel security (export controls).  Right wing libertarian sort of feel.

---

##### [Socialist Alliance](https://socialist-alliance.org/policy)

Worth a read. It all seems sensible, as long as they don't achieve total power.  Hold on - wouldn't that make it a Democratic Socialist Republic?  This part of the political swamp has really been poisoned.  These guys seem OK, though.
