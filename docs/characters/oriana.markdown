***Cursed Form.*** As long as the alpha doll's curse remains unbroken, the dolls it created cannot be destroyed. If the doll is targeted by *Remove Curse*, the doll must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the casters spell save DC. If the doll fails this saving throw or drops to 0 hit points, it becomes inanimate for 24 hours. Whenever the alpha doll's curse is broken, the doll reverts to its true form.

***False Appearance.*** While the doll remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal doll.


***No Strings on Me.*** The doll is immune to any magic that attempts to charm or control it.

***Repairable.*** The doll regains 1 hit point when a *mending* spell is cast on it.

***Spider Climb.*** The doll can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
<h2>Actions</h2>

***Multiattack.*** The doll makes two attacks: one with its shiv and one with its bite.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. *Hit:* 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to transform into a wooden doll and is restrained until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw. The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target becomes a carrionette until the alpha's curse is broken.

***Giggle.*** The doll releases a creepy giggle. The giggle has no effect on constructs and undead. All other creatures within 30 feet that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

***Shiv.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
