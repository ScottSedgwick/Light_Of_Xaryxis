## Bigby's Benificent Bracelet

Source: Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

This gorgeous jewelry piece, crafted by the wizard Bigby himself, consist of four golden rings attached by delicate chains to a wrist cuff studded with sapphires and diamonds.

**Random Properties** The bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

| *1 minor beneficial property*  | While attuned to the artifact, you have resistance against one damage type - Dan's choice |
| *1 major beneficial property*  | While attuned to the artifact, you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point |
| *1 minor detrimental property* | While attuned to the artifact, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells |

**Dextrous Fingers**.  While wearing the bracelet, you can cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand).

**Force Sculpture**. By focusing and channeling the bracelet's magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.

The copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.

The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.

**Helpful Hand**. As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast [Bigby's Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bigbys-hand) as a 9th level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
