# Light of Xaryxis, agreed rules.

## Character creation

- Players roll for their characters stats.  Roll 4d6, re-roll 1s and 2s.  Take the sum of the best 3 dice.  Repeat 6 times.
- Players roll for their characters hit points.  First level is maximum HP.  Subsequent levels are rolled for, but rolls under 50% on the dice are re-rolled.
- Characters start at 5th level.
- Characters start with normal starting equipment for their race/class/background, plus 625gp of equipment and one uncommon magic item.
- All the characters know each other at the start of the campaign - feel free to work out a backstory.
- Renaissance Firearms are available, but rare.
- There is a feat exactly the same as Crossbow Expert, but all references to "Crossbow" and replaced with "Firearm".
- Charaters get one free feat at 1st level.
- Characters get one additional language, tool or skill proficiency for each point of Int bonus.

## Firearm Feat

Thanks to extensive practice with firearms, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the loading quality of firearms with which you are proficient.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
- When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a pistol you are holding.

## Homebrew rules

1. Drinking a potion takes a bonus action.  Feeding a potion to another creature takes an action.
2. A creature being flanked cannot flank other creatures.

## Rules we are using from Ravenloft Primer

### There are some changes - read carefully.

- Casting 2 spells. There are no limitations on the combination of spells that can be cast using actions and bonus actions.
- Skill check retries. If a player fails a skill check, another player may make an attempt only if their skill modifier is higher than all previous players skill modifiers.
- Intelligence to Initiative.  Players may use either Int or Dex modifiers for Initiative rolls.
- Intelligence Bonus. Players may take one additional language, tool or skill proficiency for each Int bonus point.
- Attacks with STR or DEX.  Players may use either their STR or DEX bonus for attacks with any weapon, including ranged weapons.
- Religion checks.  Clerics and Paladins may use their WIS bonus instead of their INT bonus for Religion checks.
- Spell scrolls. Any class can read from a scroll.  Casters who are able to cast spells of the scrolls level do not have to make an Arcana check.  If the spell scroll is of a level highr than the caster can cast, they must make an Arcana check DC 10 + scroll spell level in order to cast it.  Non-casters must always make this Arcana check, and they do so with disadvantage.

## Rules we are not using from Ravenloft Primer

- Altered Resting.
- Studying Magic Items & Attunement.
- Tarokka Deck.
- Poison, Disease and Curses disclaimer.
- Tension pool.
- Dread mechanics.
- Ravenloft backgrounds.

2. Roll the damage dice as normal.
3. Add the values from 1 & 2, and the normal damage bonuses.
