        <h2></h2>
        <p><b><i>Cursed Form.</i></b> As long as the alpha doll's curse remains unbroken, the dolls it created cannot be
            destroyed. If the doll is targeted by <i>Remove Curse</i>, the doll must succeed on a Constitution saving
            throw against the casters spell save DC. If the doll fails this saving throw or drops to 0 hit points, it
            becomes inanimate for 24 hours. Whenever the alpha doll's curse is broken, the doll reverts to its true
            form.</p>
        <p><b><i>False Appearance.</i></b> While the doll remains motionless, it is indistiguishable from a normal doll.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>No Strings on Me.</i></b> The doll is immune to any magic that attempts to charm or control it.</p>
        <p><b><i>Repairable.</i></b> The doll regains 1 hit point when a <i>mending</i> spell is cast on it.</p>
        <p><b><i>Spider Climb.</i></b> The doll can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
            needing to make an ability check.</p>
        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p><b><i>Multiattack.</i></b> The doll makes two attacks: one with its shiv and one with its bite.</p>
        <p><i><b>Bite.</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. <i>Hit:</i> 1d4 bludgeoning
            damage.</p>
        <p>If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to transform
            into a wooden doll and is restrained until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw.
            The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target becomes a carrionette until the
            alpha's curse is broken.</p>
        <p><i><b>Giggle.</b></i> The doll releases a creepy giggle. The giggle has no effect on constructs and undead.
            All other creatures within 30 feet that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw taking 7 (2d6)
            psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>
        <p><i><b>Shiv.</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. <i>Hit:</i> 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing
            damage.</p>
