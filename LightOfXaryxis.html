<h2>Firearm Feat</h2>

Thanks to extensive practice with firearms, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
  <li>You ignore the loading quality of firearms with which you are proficient.</li>
  <li>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.</li>
  <li>When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a pistol you are holding.</li>
</ul>

  <li>A creature being flanked cannot flank other creatures.</li>
  <li>When drinking a potion yourself, you can take a full action, and get maximum healing from the potion.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rules we are using from Ravenloft Primer</h2>

<h3>There are some changes - read carefully.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Casting 2 spells. There are no limitations on the combination of spells that can be cast using actions and bonus actions.</li>
  <li>Skill check retries. If a player fails a skill check, another player may make an attempt only if their skill modifier is higher than all previous players skill modifiers.</li>
  <li>Intelligence to Initiative.  Players may use either Int or Dex modifiers for Initiative rolls.</li>
  <li>Intelligence Bonus. Players may take one additional language, tool or skill proficiency for each Int bonus point.</li>
  <li>Attacks with STR or DEX.  Players may use either their STR or DEX bonus for attacks with any weapon, including ranged weapons.</li>
  <li>Religion checks.  Clerics and Paladins may use their WIS bonus instead of their INT bonus for Religion checks.</li>
  <li>Spell scrolls. Any class can read from a scroll.  Casters who are able to cast spells of the scrolls level do not have to make an Arcana check.  If the spell scroll is of a level highr than the caster can cast, they must make an Arcana check DC 10 + scroll spell level in order to cast it.  Non-casters must always make this Arcana check, and they do so with disadvantage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules we are not using from Ravenloft Primer</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Altered Resting.</li>

  <li>Roll the damage dice as normal.</li>
  <li>Add the values from 1 & 2, and the normal damage bonuses.</li>
  <li>Roll d100, and look up the effect on the relevant Critical Hits table.</li>
